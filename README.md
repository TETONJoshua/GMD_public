# Installation of the project

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure your system meets the following requirements:

Operating system: Windows 10 or Windows 11
Available disk space: minimum 10 GB
RAM memory: minimum 8 GB
Internet connection to download the installation files

## Installing the IDE

Go to the official Visual Studio website at the following address: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/. 

Click on the "Download Visual Studio Community Manager" button (free version) to download the installer.
Run the downloaded installer and follow the instructions on the screen.
Select the necessary components for .NET development and database management tools. (The basic ones should be enough)

Wait for the installation to finish. This may take some time depending on your Internet connection and system speed.

## Retrieving the GIT solution

Make sure you have Git installed on your machine. If not, download and install Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads.
Open a command prompt or terminal.

Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project solution.

Run the following command to clone the Git repository:

`git clone https://gitlab.telecomnancy.univ-lorraine.fr/Antoine.Champault/gmd_projet_champault_defranoux_teton.git`

##Launching the project in Visual Studio

Open Visual Studio on your machine.
Click on "File" in the menu bar, then select "Open" and choose "Project/Solution".
Navigate to the directory where you cloned the project solution.
Select the solution file with the .sln extension and click "Open".
Once the solution is open in Visual Studio, make sure the main project is selected in the Solution Explorer.
Click on "Start" in the menu bar, this is the play button without the associated project name.

You should see a web page open and a console appear. 

The project is launched!

## Complements

The advantage of getting and running the .NET solution directly is that all the dependencies of the different libraries are already installed, you don't have to do any other installation. 

**Warning** You may be asked by the IDE to synchronize the dependencies, just click on the alert popup button.
